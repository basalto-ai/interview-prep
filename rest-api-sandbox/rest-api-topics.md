# REST API Interview Preparation Guide (Principal/Staff-Level)

## Objective

To prepare for Principal Engineer, Senior Technical Staff, or Senior Architect-level interviews by developing subject matter expertise in REST API architecture, design, development, security, performance, governance, and operations. The approach is hands-on and strategic, using the Spring Boot framework to demonstrate implementation through a short but relevant project that reflects enterprise-grade standards.

---

## Target Audience

This guide is intended for highly experienced engineers aiming for advanced technical roles such as:

- **Principal Software Engineers**
- **Senior/Staff Engineers**
- **Solutions or Enterprise Architects**
- **Technical Leads managing REST API initiatives**
- **Engineering Managers overseeing API strategy**

The content assumes deep prior experience in software engineering, Java, microservices, and real-world production APIs. It is geared toward individuals who are expected to influence API architecture, governance, security, performance, and evolution across teams or organizations.

## 1. Foundations of REST APIs

- RESTful Architecture
  - Principles and constraints
  - Stateless, Client-Server, Cacheable, Layered System, Uniform Interface
- HTTP Protocol
  - HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, CONNECT, TRACE
  - Status Codes: 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx
- Request Headers
  - Accept, Content-Type, Authorization, Correlation-ID, X-Request-ID, X-Trace-ID
- Response Headers
  - ETag, Cache-Control, Expires, Location, Retry-After, RateLimit headers
- Resources and URIs
  - Resource naming, pluralization, URI structure
- Request and Response Payloads
  - Data formats: JSON, XML, ProtoBuf
  - Content negotiation

---

## 2. Designing Effective REST APIs

- Endpoint Design
  - Resource relationships (flat vs. nested)
  - Action vs. Resource URIs
- Data Modeling
  - Representing entities and relationships
  - Handling dates, times, currency, enums
  - Schema evolution
- Querying and Filtering
  - Search, filtering, sorting, multiple filters
- Pagination Strategies
  - Offset & Limit
  - Cursor-based
  - Keyset pagination
- Partial Updates
  - PATCH, JSON Merge Patch, JSON Patch
- Bulk Operations
  - Batch create, update, delete
- Asynchronous APIs
  - 202 Accepted, polling, callbacks, Webhooks, SSE

- API Traffic Shaping & Throttling
- Multi-Region and Geo-Distributed APIs

---

## 6. API Evolution and Lifecycle
