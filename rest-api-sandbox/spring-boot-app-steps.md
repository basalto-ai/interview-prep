# Step-by-Step Guide to Create Two Spring Boot Applications

1. Setup and Initialization  
   - Use Spring Initializr to create the Product Service application, including dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database, Spring Boot Actuator.
2. Develop Product Service  
   - Implement REST endpoints:
     - GET /products: Retrieve a list of products.
     - POST /products: Create a new product.
     - GET /products/{id}: Retrieve product details.
   - Validate functionality with unit and integration tests.
3. Local Testing of Product Service  
   - Run the application locally and confirm that all endpoints work as expected.
4. Setup and Initialization for Order Service  
   - Use Spring Initializr to create the Order Service application, including dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot Actuator, and a client module (RestTemplate or WebClient) for external calls.
5. Develop Order Service  
   - Implement REST endpoints:
     - GET /orders: Retrieve a list of orders.
     - POST /orders: Create a new order.
     - GET /orders/{id}: Retrieve order details.
   - In the service layer, implement a client component to call Product Service endpoints for product validation.
6. Local Testing of Order Service  
   - Run the Order Service on a dedicated port and test each endpoint individually.
7. Configure Cross-Application Integration  
   - Configure both applications to run on different ports.
   - Verify cross-application communication by ensuring that the Order Service successfully calls the Product Service during order creation to validate product availability.
8. Documentation and API Testing  
   - Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI into both applications for interactive API documentation and testing.
9. Error Handling and Security Enhancements (Optional)  
   - Add global exception handling for structured error responses.
   - Implement basic security configurations (JWT, OAuth 2.0, etc.) as appropriate.
10. Final Integration Testing and Validation  
   - Conduct end-to-end testing to validate the integration between the two services.
   - Ensure that all APIs and client calls perform as expected under different scenarios.
